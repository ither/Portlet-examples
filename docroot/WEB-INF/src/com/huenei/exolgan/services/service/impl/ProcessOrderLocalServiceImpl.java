 * The implementation of the Tramite local service.

 * <p>
 * All custom service methods should be put in this class. Whenever methods are added, rerun ServiceBuilder to copy their definitions into the {@link com.huenei.exolgan.services.service.ProcessOrderLocalService} interface.

 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. Always use {@link com.huenei.exolgan.services.service.ProcessOrderLocalServiceUtil} to access the Tramite local service.

 *
 * <p>
 * This is a local service. Methods of this service will not have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can only be accessed from within the same VM.
